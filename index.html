		<h3>Personal Information</h3>
		<p>Hey, I'm Tye. I'm an aspiring developer/security consultant. I've recently secured the opportunity to go on Enspiral Devacademy and am really looking forward to the experience. I love learning new concepts and applying my unique problem solving skills to new problems, solving new challanges, and generally pushing the boundries of any personal limitations via constantly aquiring new knowledge and utilizing it to see things from a new perspective. </p>
		<h3>EDA and Aspirations</h3>
		<p>By learning more about development in c# I am hoping to be able to contribute my unique take on things to the world wide development community. Especially within the security industry by developing new tools, attack vectors, and defense mechanisims. I also have a side interest in data collection and utilization, which I believe ties both security and development requirements together.</p>
